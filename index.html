      <h2>so... you want to know the story behind the name Black & White</h2>
      <p>It all started in 9th grade, when we first met and found out both our names were "Nathnael".
         and having the same name was going to cause some confusion.
        and at the time, Blacks social media name was "natii Black," so friends started
       calling him 'black' and eventually people started calling "the other natty" 'white'. </p>
       <h3>and since then, we have been named Black & White.</h3>

                yes sometimes.
